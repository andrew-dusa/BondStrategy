## Brief Summary
We use treasury bond rate data to produce treasury bond total return indices and create a strategy that produces higher returns than the benchmark with slightly lower volatility leading to a higher sharpe ratio despite having a lower average duration over the studied period of time. We essentially try to predict the optimal maturity to hold based on an indicator we study. When combined with other quantitative and qualitative pieces of information this strategy may be useful in deciding if some amount of shortening of lengthening of portfolio maturity makes sense.
